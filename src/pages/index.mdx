# useFul: a React hooks library

useFul is a library of React hooks designed to simplify and expedite your application development. It takes care of atomic background tasks, allowing you to concentrate on your application's own unique requirements. Here, you'll find comprehensive guidance on how to utilize and integrate useFul's hooks into your React applications.

<Callout emoji='⚠️'>
  useFul is currently in Alpha and is **not recommended for production
  environments.** In the meantime, you can help us reach our first stable
  release by [contributing](https://github.com/ridgehkr/useful/).
</Callout>

## Getting Started

First, install useFul from NPM by running the following in your terminal:

<Install />

After the installation is complete, you can import the hooks into your React components. For example, this is how you would import the `useFetch` hook:

```tsx
import { useFetch } from '@ridgehkr/useful'
```
