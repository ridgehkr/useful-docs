# Useful Hooks

Welcome to the documentation for Useful, a library of React hooks built to make your application development simpler and faster by handling supportive functionality in the background so you can focus on your application's custom requirements. This site provides detailed information on how to use and integrate Useful's hooks into your React applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with using these custom React hooks, follow these general steps:

1. Install Useful by running the following in your terminal:

<Install />

After the installation is complete, you can import the hooks into your React components:

```tsx
// import the useFetch hook
import { useFetch } from '@ridgehkr/usefulHooks'
```

For a complete list of all available hooks, see the [list below](#hooks).
