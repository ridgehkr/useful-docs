# useUndoRedo

The `useUndoRedo` hook manages a stack of user actions to enable undo and redo functionality.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have `@ridgehkr/useful` installed in your application. If not, you can get started by following the [installation instructions](/#getting-started).

2. Import `useUndoRedo` into your component.

```tsx
import { useUndoRedo } from '@ridgehkr/useful'
```

## Example

This is a basic example where `useUndoRedo` is used to manage a stack of user actions. The actions are represented by a static string, but in practice could be anything other than `null` or `undefined`.

- `takeAction()` is used to push a new action onto the `actions` stack.
- `undo()` and `redo()` are used to pop and push actions onto the `actions` stack, respectively
- `clearActions()` is used to delete all actions from the `actions` stack as well as any preserved actions resulting from `undo()`

```tsx /useUndoRedo/ filename="UserActions.tsx"
import { useUndoRedo } from '@ridgehkr/useful'

export default function SearchInput() {
  const { actions, redo, undo, takeAction, clearActions } = useUndoRedo()

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={undo}>Undo</button>
      <button onClick={redo}>Redo</button>
      <button onClick={() => takeAction('New Action')}>Take Action</button>
      <button onClick={clearActions}>Clear Actions</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
