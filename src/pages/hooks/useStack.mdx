# `useStack()`

This is a custom hook for managing a Stack data structure in a React application. A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the top.

## Usage

To use this custom hook in your React project, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the `./src/hooks/useStack.ts` file from this sandbox into your project.
2. Import and use the useStack hook in your components:

```ts
import React from 'react'
import useStack from './path/to/useStack.ts'

function MyComponent() {
  const stack = useStack<number>()

  stack.push(1)
  stack.push(2)

  console.log('Stack:', stack.items)
  console.log('Peek:', stack.peek())
  console.log('Pop:', stack.pop())
  console.log('Size:', stack.size)

  return <div>{/* JSX content */}</div>
}

export default MyComponent
```

## API

The useStack hook returns an object with the following methods:

### `push(item: T)`

Pushes an item onto the top of the stack.

### `pop(): T | undefined`

Removes and returns the top item from the stack.

### `peek(): T | undefined`

Returns the top item from the stack without removing it.

### `size: number`

Returns the number of items in the stack.

### `items: T[]`

An array containing the items in the stack.
