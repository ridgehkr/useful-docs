# `useIdleTimeout()`

This utility hook helps you track user activity and trigger actions when the user becomes inactive for a specified period of time. It is useful for scenarios where you want to perform specific tasks, such as showing a warning message or logging out a user when there has been no user interaction for a certain amount of time.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have `@ridgehkr/useful` installed in your application. If not, you can get started by following the [installation instructions](/#getting-started).

2. Import and use the `useIdleTimeout` hook in your component:

```tsx
import { useIdleTimeout } from '@ridgehkr/useful'

const isIdle = useIdleTimeout({
  timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds of inactivity
  onIdle: () => {
    // Your code to execute when the user becomes idle
    console.log('User is idle.')
  },
})
```

## Example

This hook takes a single argument, a [React ref](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) pointing to the DOM element you want the sizing information of. It returns an object containing the element's size information.

Here's an example of how you can use the `useElementSize` hook in your React component:

```tsx
import { useIdleTimeout } from '@ridgehkr/useful'

const App = () => {
  const isIdle = useIdleTimeout({
    timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds of inactivity
    onIdle: () => {
      // Your code to execute when the user becomes idle
      console.log('User is idle.')
    },
  })

  return <div>{isIdle ? <p>User is idle.</p> : <p>User is active.</p>}</div>
}

export default App
```

In this example, the `useIdleTimeout` hook is used to monitor user activity, and it updates the `isIdle` variable to indicate whether the user is idle or active. The `onIdle` callback is executed when the user becomes idle, allowing you to perform specific actions in response to user inactivity.

## Parameters

The useElementSize hook takes a single argument:

ref: A React ref that points to the DOM element you want to monitor for size changes.

| Parameter     |   Type   | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :------: | --------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`timeout`** |  number  |      true | The duration (in milliseconds) of user inactivity required to trigger the idle state and execute the `onIdle` callback.                                   |
| **`onIdle`**  | function |      true | A callback function that will be executed when the user becomes idle. This is where you can define the actions you want to perform when the user is idle. |

## Return Value

The `useIdleTimeout` hook returns a boolean value indicating whether the user is currently idle (`true`) or active (`false`).
