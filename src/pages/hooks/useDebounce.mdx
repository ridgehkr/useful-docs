# useDebounce

This hook is designed to debounce updates to a given value. Debouncing is a technique used to delay the execution of a function or, in this case, the update of a value until a specified period of inactivity has passed. This is particularly useful when dealing with user input or API calls to avoid excessive and rapid updates.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have `@ridgehkr/useful` installed in your application. If not, you can get started by following the [installation instructions](/#getting-started).

2. Import and use the `useDebounce` hook in your component:

```tsx
import { useDebounce } from '@ridgehkr/useful'
```

### Example

`useDebounce` can be utilized by calling it within a functional component. It takes two parameters. [See the API Reference](#api-reference) for more details on these return values:

- **`value: T`** is the value that you want to debounce.
- **`delay: number`** is the delay in milliseconds before the value update is propagated.

The hook returns the debounced version of the value:

```tsx
const debouncedValue = useDebounce(value, delay)
```

#### In your React component:

```tsx /useDebounce/ filename="DebounceExample.jsx"
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { useDebounce } from '@ridgehkr/useful'

function DebounceExample() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('')
  const debouncedInputValue = useDebounce(inputValue, 500)

  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    setInputValue(e.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type='text'
        placeholder='Type something...'
        onChange={handleInputChange}
      />
      <p>Debounced Value: {debouncedInputValue}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `inputValue` state is being debounced with a delay of 500 milliseconds. The displayed "Debounced Value" will only update once the user has stopped typing for 500 milliseconds.

## API Reference

### Hook Signature

**`useDebounce(value: T, delay: number): T`**

### Parameters

`useDebounce` accepts two parameters:

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description                         |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **`value`** | `T`      | yes      | The value to debounce.              |
| **`delay`** | `number` | yes      | The debounce delay in milliseconds. |

### Return Value

| Property             | Type | Description                                 |
| :------------------- | :--- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **`debouncedValue`** | `T`  | The debounced version of the input `value`. |

## A Note on Debouncing

Keep in mind that debouncing may introduce a slight delay in reflecting the most recent value, which can be a desired behavior in some scenarios but not in others. Make sure to choose an appropriate delay value based on your application's requirements.
