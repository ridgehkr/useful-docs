# `useThrottle()`

This hook allows you to manage how frequently a given function is invoked.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have `@ridgehkr/useful` installed in your application. If not, you can get started by following the [installation instructions](/hooks).

2. Import and use the `useThrottle` hook in your component.

## Example

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import useThrottle from './useThrottle'

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const throttledIncrement = useThrottle((amount: number) => {
    setCount(count + amount)
  }, 1000)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => throttledIncrement(1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
