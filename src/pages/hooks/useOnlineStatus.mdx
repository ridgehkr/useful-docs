# useOnlineStatus

This hook is designed to help you monitor the online status of a user within your web application. It provides a simple and convenient way to determine whether the user's device is currently connected to the internet.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have `@ridgehkr/useful` installed in your application. If not, you can get started by following the [installation instructions](/#getting-started).

2. Import and use the `useOnlineStatus` hook in your component:

Here's a simple example of how you can use the `useOnlineStatus` hook in a React component:

```jsx filename="OnlineStatus.jsx"
import React from 'react'
import { useOnlineStatus } from '@ridgehkr/useful'

function OnlineStatus() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus()

  return (
    <div>
      {isOnline ? (
        <p>You are currently online.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>You are currently offline.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default OnlineStatus
```

In this example, the return from `useOnlineStatus` toggles a status message indicating whether the user is currently online or offline.

## How It Works

The hook tracks online status using the value of [`navigator.onLine`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine), which is a property provided by the browser's Navigator object. It represents the user's online status when the page initially loads.

## Parameters

The `useOnlineStatus` hook does not accept any parameters.

## Return Value

The hook returns a boolean indicating whether the user is currently online or offline.

- **`true`** - The user is currently online.
- **`false`** - The user is currently offline.
