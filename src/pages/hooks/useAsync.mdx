# `useAsync()`

The `useAsync` hook is a powerful utility for managing the state of asynchronous operations in React applications. It simplifies handling async functions, providing an easy way to track their execution status, and execute them with optional immediate invocation.

It is a valuable tool for managing asynchronous operations in React applications. It simplifies the process of tracking and executing asynchronous functions, providing clear states for loading, errors, and data. By following the documentation and examples provided, you can efficiently integrate this hook into your projects and create responsive and error-tolerant user interfaces for your async tasks.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have `@ridgehkr/usefulHooks` installed in your application. If not, you can get started by following the [installation instructions](/#getting-started).

2. Import and use the `useElementSize` hook in your component:

```tsx
import { useElementSize } from '@ridgehkr/usefulHooks'
```

### Basic Usage

The primary purpose of `useAsync` is to manage asynchronous functions. It returns an object that provides information about the state of the async function and a method to execute it.

```tsx
const { data, loading, error, run } = useAsync(asyncFunction)
```

Where:

- **`data`**: Holds the result of the async function when it completes successfully or null if it hasn't been executed yet.
- **`loading`**: A boolean indicating whether the async function is currently running.
- **`error`**: Contains any error that occurs during the async function execution or null if no errors occurred.
- **`run`**: A function that triggers the execution of the async function.

### Immediate Execution

By default, the async function passed to useAsync is executed immediately upon component render. You can control this behavior by passing a second argument to the hook.

```tsx
const { data, loading, error, run } = useAsync(asyncFunction, false)
```

Setting `immediate` to `false` means the async function will not run immediately, allowing you to trigger it manually using the `run` function.

### Accessing Async State

To access the state of your asynchronous operation, you can use the `data`, `loading`, and `error` properties as shown in the basic usage example. These values can be used in your component's render function to display loading spinners, error messages, or the fetched data.

```tsx
if (loading) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>
}

if (error) {
  return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
}

if (data) {
  return <div>Data: {data}</div>
}
```

## API Reference

### `useAsync` Parameters

| Property            |        Required?        |        Type        |                                                                                                                             Description |
| :------------------ | :---------------------: | :----------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **`asyncFunction`** |          true           | `AsyncFunction<T>` |                                        The asynchronous function that you want to manage. It must be a function that returns a Promise. |
| **`immediate`**     | false (default: `true`) |      boolean       | Determines whether the async function should run immediately upon component render or wait for manual execution using the run function. |

### useAsync Return Value

The `useAsync` hook returns an object with the following properties and methods:

| Property      |        Type         |                                                                                             Description |
| :------------ | :-----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **`data`**    | `AsyncFunction<T>`  | The result of the async function when it completes successfully or null if it hasn't been executed yet. |
| **`loading`** |       boolean       |                                   A boolean indicating whether the async function is currently running. |
| **`error`**   | `unknown` or `null` |       Contains any error that occurs during the async function execution or null if no errors occurred. |
| **`run`**     |    `() => void`     |                                           A function that triggers the execution of the async function. |

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

The `fetchData` function is executed immediately upon component render. The `loading` state is true while the function is running, and the `data` state is updated with the result of the function when it completes successfully.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useAsync } from '@ridgehkr/usefulHooks'

function App() {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    return response.json()
  }

  const { data, loading, error, run } = useAsync(fetchData)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={run}>Fetch Data</button>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {error && <p>Error: {error.message}</p>}
      {data && <p>Data: {data}</p>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Example 2: Manual Execution

Because the `immediate` flag is false, the asynchronous function `fetchData` will not run immediately upon component render. Instead, it will wait for the `run` function to be called.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import useAsync from './useAsync'

function App() {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    return response.json()
  }

  const { data, loading, error, run } = useAsync(fetchData, false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={run}>Fetch Data</button>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {error && <p>Error: {error.message}</p>}
      {data && <p>Data: {data}</p>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the `asyncFunction` passed to `useAsync` is an asynchronous function that returns a Promise.
- Use the `loading`, `error`, and `data` states to provide user feedback during the asynchronous operation.
- Consider using the `immediate` flag to control when the async function executes, depending on your use case.
