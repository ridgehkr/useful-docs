# `useIntersectionObserver()`

The `useThrottle` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to limit the frequency of a value changing to once every specified interval (defaults to 400ms). This can be especially useful when dealing with fast-changing values, such as those updated in response to user input or external events. The hook helps prevent excessive re-renders and improves performance by ensuring that the value updates are throttled to a specified interval.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have `@ridgehkr/usefulHooks` installed in your application. If not, you can get started by following the [installation instructions](/#getting-started).

2. Import and use the `useThrottle` hook in your component.

## Example

In the following example, `useIntersectionObserver` is used to lazy-load a set of images, only rendering images that are currently in the viewport.

```tsx
import images from './images'
import { useIntersectionObserver } from '@ridgehkr/useful'

const Figure = ({ src, caption }) => {
  const { ref, entry } = useIntersectionObserver({
    threshold: 0,
    root: null,
    rootMargin: '0px',
  })

  return (
    <article>
      <figure ref={ref}>
        {entry?.isIntersecting && (
          <>
            <img src={src} alt='Lazy-loaded image' />
            <figcaption>{caption}</figcaption>
          </>
        )}
      </figure>
    </article>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <h1>Lazy-Load Images</h1>
      </header>

      {images.map(({ src, caption }, index) => {
        return <Figure key={index} src={src} caption={caption} />
      })}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

In this example, the `inputValue` is updated whenever the user types in the input field. However, the actual rendering of the throttled value (`throttledValue`) will only occur at most once every 600 milliseconds. This prevents excessive re-renders when the user is rapidly typing.

## API

The `IntersectionObserverOptions` are passed directly into the `IntersectionObserver` constructor. You can read [the full documentation for these options on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API#intersection_observer_options).

### `useIntersectionObserver(options: IntersectionObserverOptions)`

- **`root`** `(HTMLElement | null)`\
  The element that is used as the viewport for checking the visibility of the target. Can be null or an HTMLElement.
- **`rootMargin`** `(string)`\
  A margin around the root element to adjust the intersection area.
- **`threshold`** `(number | number[])`\
  Either a single number or an array of numbers indicating the proportion of the target element's visibility needed to trigger the observer's callback.

### Return Value

- **`ref`**\
  A [React ref](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef) that should be assigned to the element you want to observe.
- **`entry`**\
  An instance of IntersectionObserverEntry containing information about the intersection of the observed element.
